Field,,,,,,,,,,,Use,Reserve,Reserve,Type,Description
apiVersion,,,,,,,,,,,,,,string, APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value�C and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/api-conventions.md#resources
groupNames,,,,,,,,,,,,,,array, GroupNames holds all the groups directly bound to the role. This field should only be specified when supporting legacy clients and servers. See Subjects for further details.
,[string],,,,,,,,,,,,,string, 
kind,,,,,,,,,,,,,,string, Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/api-conventions.md#types-kinds
metadata,,,,,,,,,,,,,,v1.ObjectMeta, Standard object&apos;s metadata.
,annotations,,,,,,,,,,,,,object, Annotations is an unstructured key value map stored with a resource that may be set by external tools to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata. They are not queryable and should be preserved when modifying objects. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/annotations
,,[string],,,,,,,,,,,,string, 
,clusterName,,,,,,,,,,,,,string, The name of the cluster which the object belongs to. This is used to distinguish resources with same name and namespace in different clusters. This field is not set anywhere right now and apiserver is going to ignore it if set in create or update request.
,creationTimestamp,,,,,,,,,,,,,v1.Time, CreationTimestamp is a timestamp representing the server time when this object was created. It is not guaranteed to be set in happens-before order across separate operations. Clients may not set this value. It is represented in RFC3339 form and is in UTC.Populated by the system. Read-only. Null for lists. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/api-conventions.md#metadata
,deletionGracePeriodSeconds,,,,,,,,,,,,,integer, Number of seconds allowed for this object to gracefully terminate before it will be removed from the system. Only set when deletionTimestamp is also set. May only be shortened. Read-only.
,deletionTimestamp,,,,,,,,,,,,,v1.Time, DeletionTimestamp is RFC 3339 date and time at which this resource will be deleted. This field is set by the server when a graceful deletion is requested by the user�C and is not directly settable by a client. The resource is expected to be deleted (no longer visible from resource lists�C and not reachable by name) after the time in this field. Once set�C this value may not be unset or be set further into the future�C although it may be shortened or the resource may be deleted prior to this time. For example�C a user may request that a pod is deleted in 30 seconds. The Kubelet will react by sending a graceful termination signal to the containers in the pod. After that 30 seconds�C the Kubelet will send a hard termination signal (SIGKILL) to the container and after cleanup�C remove the pod from the API. In the presence of network partitions�C this object may still exist after this timestamp�C until an administrator or automated process can determine the resource is fully terminated. If not set�C graceful deletion of the object has not been requested.Populated by the system when a graceful deletion is requested. Read-only. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/api-conventions.md#metadata
,finalizers,,,,,,,,,,,,,array, Must be empty before the object is deleted from the registry. Each entry is an identifier for the responsible component that will remove the entry from the list. If the deletionTimestamp of the object is non-nil�C entries in this list can only be removed.
,,[string],,,,,,,,,,,,string, 
,generateName,,,,,,,,,,,,,string, GenerateName is an optional prefix�C used by the server�C to generate a unique name ONLY IF the Name field has not been provided. If this field is used�C the name returned to the client will be different than the name passed. This value will also be combined with a unique suffix. The provided value has the same validation rules as the Name field�C and may be truncated by the length of the suffix required to make the value unique on the server.If this field is specified and the generated name exists�C the server will NOT return a 409 - instead�C it will either return 201 Created or 500 with Reason ServerTimeout indicating a unique name could not be found in the time allotted�C and the client should retry (optionally after the time indicated in the Retry-After header).Applied only if Name is not specified.

,generation,,,,,,,,,,,,,integer, A sequence number representing a specific generation of the desired state. Populated by the system. Read-only.
,initializers,,,,,,,,,,,,,v1.Initializers, An initializer is a controller which enforces some system invariant at object creation time. This field is a list of initializers that have not yet acted on this object. If nil or empty�C this object has been completely initialized. Otherwise�C the object is considered uninitialized and is hidden (in list/watch and get calls) from clients that haven&apos;t explicitly asked to observe uninitialized objects.When an object is created�C the system will populate this list with the current set of initializers. Only privileged users may set or modify this list. Once it is empty�C it may not be modified further by any user.
,,pending,,,,,,,,,,,,array, Pending is a list of initializers that must execute in order before this object is visible. When the last pending initializer is removed�C and no failing result is set�C the initializers struct will be set to nil and the object is considered as initialized and visible to all clients.
,,,name,,,,,,,,,,,string, name of the process that is responsible for initializing this object.
,,result,,,,,,,,,,,,v1.Status, If result is set with the Failure field�C the object will be persisted to storage and then deleted�C ensuring that other clients can observe the deletion.
,,,apiVersion,,,,,,,,,,,string, APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value�C and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/api-conventions.md#resources
,,,code,,,,,,,,,,,integer, Suggested HTTP return code for this status�C 0 if not set.
,,,details,,,,,,,,,,,v1.StatusDetails, Extended data associated with the reason.  Each reason may define its own extended details. This field is optional and the data returned is not guaranteed to conform to any schema except that defined by the reason type.
,,,,causes,,,,,,,,,,array, The Causes array includes more details associated with the StatusReason failure. Not all StatusReasons may provide detailed causes.
,,,,,field,,,,,,,,,string, The field of the resource that has caused this error�C as named by its JSON serialization. May include dot and postfix notation for nested attributes. Arrays are zero-indexed.  Fields may appear more than once in an array of causes due to fields having multiple errors. Optional.Examples:  &quot;name&quot; - the field &quot;name&quot; on the current resource  &quot;items[0].name&quot; - the field &quot;name&quot; on the first array entry in &quot;items&quot;
,,,,,message,,,,,,,,,string, A human-readable description of the cause of the error.  This field may be presented as-is to a reader.

Name is primarily intended for creation idempotence and configuration definition. Cannot be updated. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/identifiers#names
,namespace,,,,,,,,,,,,,string, Namespace defines the space within each name must be unique. An empty namespace is equivalent to the &quot;default&quot; namespace�C but &quot;default&quot; is the canonical representation.

More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/namespaces
,ownerReferences,,,,,,,,,,,,,array, List of objects depended by this object. If ALL objects in the list have been deleted�C this object will be garbage collected.

roleRef,,,,,,,,,,,,,,v1.ObjectReference, RoleRef can only reference the current namespace and the global namespace. If the RoleRef cannot be resolved�C the Authorizer must return an error. Since Policy is a singleton�C this is sufficient knowledge to locate a role.

subjects,,,,,,,,,,,,,,array, Subjects hold object references to authorize with this rule. This field is ignored if UserNames or GroupNames are specified to support legacy clients and servers. Thus newer clients that do not need to support backwards compatibility should send only fully qualified Subjects and should omit the UserNames and GroupNames fields. Clients that need to support backwards compatibility can use this field to build the UserNames and GroupNames.
