Field,,,,,,,,,,,Use,Reserve,Reserve,Type,Description
apiVersion,,,,,,,,,,,,,,string, APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value�C and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/api-conventions.md#resources
kind,,,,,,,,,,,,,,string, Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/api-conventions.md#types-kinds
metadata,,,,,,,,,,,,,,v1.ObjectMeta, Standard object&apos;s metadata. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/api-conventions.md#metadata
,annotations,,,,,,,,,,,,,object, Annotations is an unstructured key value map stored with a resource that may be set by external tools to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata. They are not queryable and should be preserved when modifying objects. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/annotations
,,[string],,,,,,,,,,,,string, 
,clusterName,,,,,,,,,,,,,string, The name of the cluster which the object belongs to. This is used to distinguish resources with same name and namespace in different clusters. This field is not set anywhere right now and apiserver is going to ignore it if set in create or update request.
,creationTimestamp,,,,,,,,,,,,,v1.Time, CreationTimestamp is a timestamp representing the server time when this object was created. It is not guaranteed to be set in happens-before order across separate operations. Clients may not set this value. It is represented in RFC3339 form and is in UTC.Populated by the system. Read-only. Null for lists. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/api-conventions.md#metadata
,deletionGracePeriodSeconds,,,,,,,,,,,,,integer, Number of seconds allowed for this object to gracefully terminate before it will be removed from the system. Only set when deletionTimestamp is also set. May only be shortened. Read-only.
,deletionTimestamp,,,,,,,,,,,,,v1.Time, DeletionTimestamp is RFC 3339 date and time at which this resource will be deleted. This field is set by the server when a graceful deletion is requested by the user�C and is not directly settable by a client. The resource is expected to be deleted (no longer visible from resource lists�C and not reachable by name) after the time in this field. Once set�C this value may not be unset or be set further into the future�C although it may be shortened or the resource may be deleted prior to this time. For example�C a user may request that a pod is deleted in 30 seconds. The Kubelet will react by sending a graceful termination signal to the containers in the pod. After that 30 seconds�C the Kubelet will send a hard termination signal (SIGKILL) to the container and after cleanup�C remove the pod from the API. In the presence of network partitions�C this object may still exist after this timestamp�C until an administrator or automated process can determine the resource is fully terminated. If not set�C graceful deletion of the object has not been requested.Populated by the system when a graceful deletion is requested. Read-only.

,,[string],,,,,,,,,,,,string, 
,generateName,,,,,,,,,,,,,string, GenerateName is an optional prefix�C used by the server�C to generate a unique name ONLY IF the Name field has not been provided. If this field is used�C the name returned to the client will be different than the name passed. This value will also be combined with a unique suffix. The provided value has the same validation rules as the Name field�C and may be truncated by the length of the suffix required to make the value unique on the server.If this field is specified and the generated name exists�C the server will NOT return a 409 - instead�C it will either return 201 Created or 500 with Reason ServerTimeout indicating a unique name could not be found in the time allotted�C and the client should retry (optionally after the time indicated in the Retry-After header).Applied only if Name is not specified.

Only privileged users may set or modify this list. Once it is empty�C it may not be modified further by any user.
,,pending,,,,,,,,,,,,array, Pending is a list of initializers that must execute in order before this object is visible.

At least one of &apos;backend&apos; or &apos;rules&apos; must be specified. This field is optional to allow the loadbalancer controller or defaulting logic to specify a global default.
,,serviceName,,,,,,,,,,,,string, Specifies the name of the referenced service.
,,servicePort,,,,,,,,,,,,intstr.IntOrString, Specifies the port of the referenced service.
,rules,,,,,,,,,,,,,array, A list of host rules used to configure the Ingress. If unspecified�C or no rule matches�C all traffic is sent to the default backend.
,,host,,,,,,,,,,,,string, Host is the fully qualified domain name of a network host�C as defined by RFC 3986. Note the following deviations from the &quot;host&quot; part of the URI as defined in the RFC: 1. IPs are not allowed. Currently an IngressRuleValue can only apply to the	  IP in the Spec of the parent Ingress.2. The `:` delimiter is not respected because ports are not allowed.	  Currently the port of an Ingress is implicitly :80 for http and	  :443 for https.Both these may change in the future. Incoming requests are matched against the host before the IngressRuleValue. If the host is unspecified�C the Ingress routes all traffic based on the specified IngressRuleValue.
,,http,,,,,,,,,,,,v1beta1.HTTPIngressRuleValue, 
,,,paths,,,,,,,,,,,array, A collection of paths that map requests to backends.
,,,,backend,,,,,,,,,,v1beta1.IngressBackend, Backend defines the referenced service endpoint to which the traffic will be forwarded to.
,,,,,serviceName,,,,,,,,,string, Specifies the name of the referenced service.
,,,,,servicePort,,,,,,,,,intstr.IntOrString, Specifies the port of the referenced service.
,,,,path,,,,,,,,,,string, Path is an extended POSIX regex as defined by IEEE Std 1003.1�C (i.e this follows the egrep/unix syntax�C not the perl syntax) matched against the path of an incoming request. Currently it can contain characters disallowed from the conventional &quot;path&quot; part of a URL as defined by RFC 3986. Paths must begin with a &apos;/&apos;. If unspecified�C the path defaults to a catch all sending traffic to the backend.
,tls,,,,,,,,,,,,,array, TLS configuration. Currently the Ingress only supports a single TLS port�C 443. If multiple members of this list specify different hosts�C they will be multiplexed on the same port according to the hostname specified through the SNI TLS extension�C if the ingress controller fulfilling the ingress supports SNI.
,,hosts,,,,,,,,,,,,array, Hosts are a list of hosts included in the TLS certificate. The values in this list must match the name/s used in the tlsSecret. Defaults to the wildcard host setting for the loadbalancer controller fulfilling this Ingress�C if left unspecified.
,,,[string],,,,,,,,,,,string, 
,,secretName,,,,,,,,,,,,string, SecretName is the name of the secret used to terminate SSL traffic on 443. Field is left optional to allow SSL routing based on SNI hostname alone. If the SNI host in a listener conflicts with the &quot;Host&quot; header field used by an IngressRule�C the SNI host is used for termination and value of the Host header is used for routing.
status,,,,,,,,,,,,,,v1beta1.IngressStatus, Status is the current state of the Ingress. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/api-conventions.md#spec-and-status
,loadBalancer,,,,,,,,,,,,,v1.LoadBalancerStatus, LoadBalancer contains the current status of the load-balancer.
